;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a major mode to work with files written
;; in https://cuelang.org

;;; Code:

(defvar cue-mode-font-lock-keywords)
(setq cue-mode-font-lock-keywords
      `(
        ("\\(//\\)\\(.*\\)$"
         (1 font-lock-comment-delimiter-face t)
         (2 font-lock-comment-face t))
        ("\\([\\{\\}\(\)]\\)"  (1 font-lock-keyword-face))
        ("\\(package\\|import\\|&\\||\\|*\\)"  (1 font-lock-keyword-face))
        ("\\([A-Za-z0-1\\ ]+: \\)"   (1 font-lock-variable-name-face))
        ("\\([A-Za-z0-1\\ ]+:: \\)"  (1 font-lock-constant-face))))
