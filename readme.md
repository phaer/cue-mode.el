# cue-mode.el

A simple Emacs major mode for [cuelang](https://cuelang.org).

At the moment it does very basic syntax highlighting and uses `json-mode`'s
indentation which is good enough for the moment, but could be improved.

## TODO

* Add all builtin funcitons to keywords.
* Fix indentation to be identical with `cue fmt`.
* Run `cue vet` on save.
